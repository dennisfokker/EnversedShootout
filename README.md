# Enversed Shootout
Project made for Enversed, based in Eindhoven. Concept credit goes to them.

## How to setup project
* Clone the repo;
* Download `Stylized Desert Environment` from Marketplace (https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/stylized-desert-environment);
    - Not included in git due to some filesizes exceeding 100mb.
    - Asset pack is free at time of writing.
* Open project using Unreal Engine 4.19.2;
* Move added `StylizedDesertEnv` folder into the `External` folder.
* ???
* Profit!

## Playing the game
* Room setup should be 2x4 meters for optimal experience.
* In order to join each other, make sure Steam is turned off and you're on the same LAN network. Then you should be able to host (press 'H') and join (press 'J') each other.
    - In case this doesn't work, try restarting the game (classic).
    - Still no luck? Host as you normally would and find your local IP address. Join as follows: open the console and use the following command `join <local IP address of host>`.
* 1v1 games only.

## Controls
* Triggers to shoot, move around by walking (available room is indicated via rectangle).
* Shoot the target in the middle to ready-up, round starts once both are ready.
* Shoot the other person in the head, keep gun overheating in mind!
* Shoot the targets to the sides to make bullets arrive at your opponent from non-frontal angles.
* One hit. One kill.
